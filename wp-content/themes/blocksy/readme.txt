== Description ==

Blocksy is a fast and lightweight WordPress theme built with the latest web technologies. It was designed from the ground up to be fully compatible with the Gutenberg editor and offers deep integration with popular page builders like Elementor, Brizy, and Beaver Builder. With a modern and modular architecture, Blocksy gives you full control over your site’s layout, colors, typography, and functionality.

It’s ideal for creating any type of website, including blogs, portfolios, business sites, and WooCommerce stores. The theme is responsive, translation-ready, accessibility-ready, and SEO-friendly. It also includes features like advanced header and footer builders, customizable sidebars, global design controls, and extended WooCommerce compatibility including AJAX filters, product galleries, and off-canvas features.

Blocksy is built for performance and flexibility, offering a solid foundation for both beginners and developers who want a reliable, extendable theme that works out of the box.

== Features ==

* Advanced Header & Footer Builder – Drag-and-drop builder with sticky, transparent, and overlapping header options. Create unique headers/footers per page or post with conditional logic.
* Content Blocks System – Create reusable content sections and display them anywhere using hooks, shortcodes, or custom triggers.
* Custom Sidebars & Widget Areas – Assign different sidebars to individual posts, pages, categories, and more.
* Built-in Dark Mode Toggle – Offer users an automatic or manual dark mode switch without third-party plugins.
* Global Color Palette System – Define and manage global color variables for consistent design across your site.
* Custom Layouts per Post Type – Control the structure of archives, single posts, pages, and custom post types with flexible layout presets.
* Performance-First Modular System – Disable unused theme features to reduce bloat and improve load times.
* Developer Friendly – Clean, extendable code with WordPress hooks, filters, and custom code injection for JS/CSS.
* Dynamic Content Controls – Use conditional display rules for headers, content blocks, footers, and widgets based on user roles, pages, devices, and more.
* Modern Design Toolkit – Responsive controls, custom spacing, advanced typography, transparent headers, and more design freedom with no code.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Type in Blocksy in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Build Instructions ==

This theme contains some JavaScript files that need a compilation step in
order to be consumable by the browsers. The compilation is done by the
[`build-process`](https://github.com/creative-Themes/build-process) package
(which is just a preset config over WebPack). We do plan to eventually migrate
over to [`wp-scripts`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/scripts)
as the build pipeline.

So, in order to build the theme files, you need to execute these commands:

1. `npm install` or `yarn install`, both work just fine.
2. `npm run build` -- for a production build, or `npm run dev` for developments builds, which include a proper file watcher
3. The final files will be included in `admin/dashboard/static/bundle` and `static/bundle` directories.

The repeated `BlocksyReact`, `BlocksyReactDOM` and `wp.element` got enqueued
that way for two reasons:

1. We started to use React Hooks in WordPress 5.1, and we needed an actual
version of `wp.element` for that. A version of `wp.element` with hooks got
shipped only with WordPress 5.2. We planned on getting rid of our global version as
soon as 5.2 got released, but now I see a problem with backwards
compatibility.
2. We need to use a global version of React and ReactDOM because we have some
components using hooks both in the theme an din the `blocksy-companion` plugin
(https://creativethemes.com/downloads/blocksy-companion.zip). That way we
avoid breaking the rules of hooks.
